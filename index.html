<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="card">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
I am a Computer Science postgraduate student currently pursuing my 
<b>M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amity University, Bengaluru</b>.
I hold a strong academic foundation with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering
and a Diploma in Computer Science, which has helped me build a deep understanding
of core computing concepts, software development, and problem solving.
</p>

<p>
My technical interests lie at the intersection of <b>Software Engineering, Machine Learning,
and Computer Vision</b>. I have hands-on experience developing real-world applications using
Python, Flutter, and modern development tools. During my internship with the
<b>Samsung PRISM Program</b>, I worked on a research-driven project in <b>Semantic Image Editing</b>,
where I optimized SPADE and SEASAME architectures to reduce computational redundancy
and improve inference performance. This work led to an <b>IEEE publication</b>,
strengthening my passion for research and applied AI.
</p>

<p>
In addition to research, I have industry experience building production-ready applications.
I have developed machine learning–integrated mobile applications, secure file-sharing systems,
and NLP-based solutions. I enjoy transforming ideas into scalable, efficient systems and
continuously upskilling myself in emerging technologies. I am actively seeking opportunities
where I can contribute as a <b>Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Research Intern</b>,
while continuing to grow as a technologist.

<!-- EXPERIENCE STORIES -->
<section class="card">
    <h2>Experience & Stories</h2>

    <h3>Samsung PRISM – Research Intern</h3>
    <p class="story">
        This was my first deep exposure to research. I worked on <b>Semantic Image Editing</b>,
        optimizing SPADE and SEASAME architectures. I reduced redundant computation and
        improved inference speed while maintaining visual quality.
        The project resulted in an <b>IEEE publication</b>, which shaped my interest in ML research.
    </p>

    <h3>Cognovative Technologies – Flutter Intern</h3>
    <p class="story">
        I developed a real-time <b>Bag Counter Application</b> using image classification.
        This project taught me how ML models integrate with production mobile apps and
        how automation reduces human errors in industrial workflows.
    </p>

    <h3>Cuvasol Technologies – Mobile App Developer</h3>
    <p class="story">
        I led iOS development for a Flutter-based interview preparation app.
        I handled REST APIs, testing, and App Store deployment using Xcode,
        gaining real-world product release experience.
